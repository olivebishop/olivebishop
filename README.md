"In some ways, programming is like painting. You start with a blank canvas and certain basic raw materials. You use a combination of science, art, and craft to determine what to do with them." - Andrew Hunt

Hello my name is olive I'm 23 years old and I found my passion in coding so I'm a Full Stack Developer, 
I love photography , music , safari,  making new friends drawing and writing poetry.

My journey as a programmer started way back in high school during school times of computer sympoziums and mainly when i was in the last grade we were given a project to work which was going to be added in our grading system , so i had this program that i wanted to create but i lacked ideas beacuse i was running the programmer under MS Acess, and some visul basic codes this thing made me angry and my Computer Teacher MR.David Kwemoi gave me hope that if i need to make my program be that dyanamic i should work hard and get the knowledge at high leverl education and here Iam , i have never given hope am a leaving testimony and God is my strenth.

Now I'm Full Stack developer, a freelancer at upwork and Ajira Kenya also a student at INSTITUTE OF SOFTWARE TECHOLOGIES
